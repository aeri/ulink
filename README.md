<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

A simple and modern URL actor deployed with a docker-compose with a distributed architecture.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Features

* System information. 
* Statistics of the URL of the client (number of clicks, ranking of origins, browsers and most used platforms of the shortened link).
* QR code associated with the shortened URI requested by the client.
* Reachability check before creating a short URL and warning the user if he wants to continue with the generation in case of not being reachable.
* Check against the Google Safe Browsing service and notify the customer requesting a redirection if the destination is dangerous.
